intel-mkl (2019.1.144-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Make dependency on libomp-dev mandatory since iomp5 is the default
    threading model used by libmkl-rt. Also make libmkl-rt depend on
    devel packages instead of lib packages because libmkl-rt is calling
    these libraries through libdl. (Closes: #920730)
  * Update test scripts and Makefile in debian/tests.
  * Replace embedded jquery in documentation/ja with symlink to libjs-jquery.
  * Fix a spelling error in README.Debian.
